It's an understatement to say that a lot of people don't even know how money works but it plays an important role in our life. It pays the bills, it gives us access to a lot of resources where we couldn’t have it by not having money at all.

Even if we depend on money to live our daily lives, our society still considers money as an evil entity. It’s true that money has also been an issue for a lot of people that can break families and friendship but that comes from the misuse and our attitude about money.

We could define money as a way we exchange value and energy. The more value and energy you put into your work, the more valuable your work should be. 

They say Money won’t bring you happiness; neither does poverty. It’s just a self fulfilling prophecy. Happiness isn’t related to how much you can earn. But it's undeniable that it Money will solve most of our financial issues which can help us rethink what to do with the free time we have.
